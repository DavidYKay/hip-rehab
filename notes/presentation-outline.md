# Intro

You may have heard of "Couch to 5K," an app that guides sedentary people from no physical activity to running a 5K, step by step.
What I've been working on this weekend is a similar solution, aimed at hip-replacement patients, working title, "Knife to 5K."
*BEAT*

Our goal is to help hip-replacement patients achieve the best possible recovery after surgery.

Let's dive in:

# Problem

## Early Difficulty

Two main problems with hip replacement: 

1. Muscular: that is, healing the (major) muscular damage from surgery
2. Neural: Meaning, accustoming to new joint behavior (Replacing human tissues with metal results in a very different joint!)

So, performing daily activities (walking, climbing stairs, etc), as before is a huge challenge.
Many patients find that their old muscular activation patterns don't work properly with their damaged muscles and new hip joint.
Thus, physical therapy is an important step to both: A. regrow muscle tissue and B. re-learn proper muscular activation patterns.

## Permanent Damage

To make matters worse, if healthy patterns are not learned in the first six months after surgery, improper muscular activation patterns will set in and can be hellish to undo.

So, what's the lay of the land?

* Some patients don't go to PT at all. 
* Some patients go to PT, but don't stick with their at-home program. 
* Many patients may go to PT, stick with their program, but it's not properly customized to their needs.

Clearly, there's room for improvement in PT.

## Provider impact

OK, so that's the patient side. Why do providers care?
Well, hopefully out of the goodness of their hearts, 
*half-BEAT*
but providers can come under fire for poor patient results, either in the form of lawsuits or ACA penalties patient readmission. 

Surely there's something to be done for them...

# Solution

With those problems in mind,  

I propose a solution that:

1. Motivates patients to ADHERE to their programs 
2. Maximizes chances of a SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME for the patient
3. And also allows care providers to MITIGATE READMISSION RISK 

How? So glad you asked.

## Adherence: education, goals, feedback

1.  Motivates patients to ADHERE to their programs by two methods:
A. providing them with evidence-based goals 
B. education on the importance of proper PT for restoration their activities of daily living.

Let patients know the norms.
Patients may not know what a normal range-of-motion is after surgery. 
When we welcome them into the program, we can inform them about what to expect based on historic data from people with similar age, sex, location, etc.

We can educate them on issues such as the 6-month window we discussed earlier, so that they are aware that they are in control of their own fates!

In order to deepend their personal commitment to the program, we can ask them to set goals.

## Successful Outcome: Personalized guidance and feedback

2. Maximizes patient chances at a SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME by providing personalized guidance and feedback as they practice their physical therapy, 

[SHOW DIAGRAM]

As we see in the diagram,

* Physical therapist prescribes a program 
* App teaches patient the movements, 
* patient performs each workout, guided by the app
* Every X interval, patient or PT can perform a test, from the standard range-of-motion test, a strength test, or a gait symmetry analysis and record it.
* Based on findings, we can adjust the patient's workout regimen.
* Next workout, the patient finds his new regimen waiting for him.

## Mitigate readmission risk: Hospital monitoring dashboard

3. Finally, care providers can MITIGATE READMISSION RISK by monitoring objective data on patient adherence and recovery metrics such as range-of-motion.

As a provider, what's the benefit?

Well, apart from the ability to brag about one's success rates and patient outcomes, the ACA penalizes healthcare providers for high readmission rates.

For example, let's say that we know that if a patient has not achieved a full "120/45/30" range of motion by week 12, they are unlikely to achieve a full recovery.

As long as that patient or his PT has been logging his progress with our app, we can identify these problem patients ahead of time and give the hospital the opportunity to intervene.

Similarly, if a patient HASN'T been using the app, we can call him up on the phone and see if he needs a nudge in order to adhere to his regimen.

So, by adopting a solution such as this, providers can tighten the feedback loop with patients.

# Walkthrough

# Demo of prototype

For today, I wanted to present a quick taste of what the system will look like.

On the projector, we see the PT's dashboard.
On my phone, I have the patient's app.

Happy scenario:

1. Patient records range of motion
2. Patient receives a congrats!
3. We see a green check on the PT dashboard
4. We see a tiny blip on the hospital dashboard.

Unhappy scenario:

1. Patient records range of motion
2. Patient receives an "uh oh."
3. We see a warning on the PT dashboard
4. We see a warning on the hospital dashboard.

# Science

Clearly, this is a very simple system so far. 

But there is great potential to improve our understanding of the recovery process.

For example, Dr. Bergmann's Orthoload database is a goldmine of information on the mechanics of the hip. He and his team have collected a vast amount of movement data, using sensor-equipped "smart implants" in real, live hip-replacement patients.

In the short term, we may be able to combine his findings with our patient data to develop more effective physical therapy programs.

In the long term, I imagine every hip replacement will be a "smart implant," fully aware of its position at any moment. Think of it: we could conceivably coach patients and monitor their movement in real-time, catching neuromuscular issues far before they develop into real problems!

I don't need to belabor the point: I see a lot of potential in this system.

# Wrap

So, to wrap up:
We've just seen a solution that can offer great value to both patients and providers.
By giving patients and providers not just an app but a system, we have the opportunity to consistently provide better outcomes after a hip replacement surgery.
This could obviously be implemented for other procedures, such as knee and shoulder replacement, but hip is a fine starting place.
With your support, we can take the first steps towards making this prototype into a real solution with the potential to better the lives of millions of people.
Thank you!
